##### About

Our second short animation, Cloudy_Dream (2021), is also an environmental film that addresses the urgent issue of water scarcity. The story follows a careless young boy who leaves the faucet running, unaware of the consequences of wasting water. One day, he discovers a pair of magical glasses that open a new path before him, revealing a future without water. There, he witnesses the impact of his careless actions and decides to make amends.

This 3D animation took a full year of tireless work to complete. The production process was far more complex than our previous project. Although we had gained more experience in animation-making, a lack of precise planning and numerous obstacles extended the timeline significantly.

Like Green and Blue, this project was created entirely without outside guidance or assistance. Every aspectâ€”concept and story, storyboard, scene and character modeling, animation, lighting, rendering and compositing, visual effects, sound design, and musicâ€”was carried out by us alone.

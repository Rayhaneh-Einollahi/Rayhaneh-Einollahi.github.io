##### About

Our first animation, "Green and Blue" (2018), is a 3D environmental short about air pollution, offering simple solutions to this serious problem.

Creating animations is always challenging and time-consuming, but this project took nearly a full year to complete due to our inexperience at the time. Still, the process became an incredible learning journey.

From the initial idea and storyboard to 3D modeling, animation, lighting, rendering, compositing, and sound designâ€”every step was done entirely by us. "Green and Blue" went on to be selected and screened at several national and international festivals.

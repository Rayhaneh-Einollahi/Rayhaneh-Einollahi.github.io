This repository contains five Digital Logic Design projects implemented in **SystemVerilog** and simulated using Modelsim simulator. Projects cover combinational and sequential circuits, ALU design, pseudo-random number generation, and division units.

---

## Projects

1. **SystemVerilog Introduction & Simulation**

   * Learn SystemVerilog syntax and simulation workflow.
   * Create simple combinational modules.

2. **ALU Design (Combinational Modules)**

   * Implement arithmetic (add, subtract) and logic (AND, OR, XOR) operations.
   * Modular design for easy reuse and simulation verification.

3. **Pseudo-Random Number Generator**

   * Design hardware for generating pseudo-random numbers using LFSR or similar methods.
   * Test randomness through simulation.

4. **Sequential Circuits**

   * Design counters, shift registers, and finite state machines.
   * Verify timing and functionality with simulation.

5. **Divider Unit**

   * Implement integer division with quotient and remainder.
   * Can be sequential or combinational.
